[Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) is a library that makes application side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) easier to manage.

This directory contains the sagas of the application. Sagas will for example connect to an API to fetch data, perform actions, etc.
